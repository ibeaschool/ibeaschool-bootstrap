IBEA school website built on a bootstrap theme.

- Original theme: https://bootstrapmade.com/demo/Bocor/
- Original theme files as zip for reference (first commit): Bocor-original-theme-files.zip

To edit the website see the following files:

- `index.html`: Home page content
- `donate.html`: Donate page content
- `gallery.html` : Gallery page (uses unite plugin and its own css/js. read more here https://unitegallery.net/index.php?page=tiles-columns-options) 
- The images are in `assets/` folder.
- All required css, js etc are also in the `assets/` folder.

To view the website locally, just download the code (or folder) from git, and run a webserver at the root of the project. Usually you can just run a simple python server using the command (on mac/linux): 

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

This will run the server on port 8000. Read more here:
